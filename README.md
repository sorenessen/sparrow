# Sparrow Workspace Runner

<img width="214" height="214" alt="sparrow-icon-1024-BtwIhqfI" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c149a6-2427-450c-a281-81e6d530f999" />


Sparrow is a desktop workspace runner built with **Tauri + Rust + TypeScript**.

It combines a real PTY-backed system shell with a sidebar task runner powered by a `sparrow.toml` configuration file.

The goal is simple:

**Turn the commands you already run in a terminal into reproducible, one-click tasks.**

# Overview

Sparrow provides:

• a real interactive terminal  
• a workspace-aware task runner  
• a minimal UI for executing project workflows  

Instead of remembering commands or switching between scripts, you encode them in `sparrow.toml` and execute them directly from Sparrow.

<a id="what-sparrow-is"></a>
# What Sparrow Is

Sparrow is:

• a real terminal (PTY shell)  
• a lightweight task runner  
• a desktop developer utility  
• a workflow orchestration layer

Sparrow is **not**:

• a replacement for your shell  
• a package manager  
• a heavy build tool

It is intentionally thin and sits on top of the tools you already use.

---

<a id="architecture"></a>
# Architecture

Sparrow has two primary layers.

## Rust Backend (Tauri)

The backend is responsible for interacting with the system shell.

Responsibilities:

• Spawn a PTY (pseudo terminal)  
• Launch the user's shell (`zsh`, `bash`, etc.)  
• Stream terminal output to the frontend  
• Accept keyboard input from the UI  
• Parse `sparrow.toml`  
• Discover available tasks  
• Execute tasks by writing commands into the shell

Key Rust components:

• `portable-pty` – PTY creation and management  
• `tauri` – desktop application framework  
• `serde` – serialization  
• `toml` – configuration parsing  
• `OnceCell` – persistent PTY writer storage

Execution flow:

1. Sparrow launches and spawns a PTY shell
2. The backend searches upward for `sparrow.toml`
3. Tasks are parsed from the TOML file
4. Tasks are sent to the frontend
5. Clicking a task writes commands into the shell
6. Shell output streams back to the UI

This design ensures Sparrow behaves exactly like a normal terminal session.

## TypeScript Frontend

The frontend renders the terminal UI and sidebar.

Built with:

• Vite  
• xterm.js  
• xterm FitAddon

Responsibilities:

• Render a real terminal interface  
• Display the task sidebar  
• Send commands to the backend  
• Receive shell output events  
• Maintain terminal sizing

Terminal resizing uses the FitAddon so the PTY dimensions stay synchronized with the UI.

# Running Sparrow (Development)

## Prerequisites

Install:

• Node.js 18+  
• Rust (stable toolchain)  
• Cargo  
• Tauri CLI

Install Tauri CLI:

```
cargo install tauri-cli
```

## Install dependencies

```
cd sparrow-app
npm install
```

## Start Sparrow

```
npm run tauri dev
```

This command:

1. launches the Vite frontend
2. compiles the Rust backend
3. opens the Sparrow desktop window

### Launch Steps

#### Click or type selection for work group

#### Paste the path to app home directory to the left. Configured tasks appear to the left

<a id="important-dev-vs-tauri-dev"></a>
# Important: dev vs tauri dev

Do NOT run:

```
npm run dev
```

This only launches the Vite development server and **does not start the Sparrow application.**

Always run:

```
npm run tauri dev
```

---

<a id="using-sparrow"></a>
# Using Sparrow

1. Launch Sparrow
2. Sparrow searches for `sparrow.toml`
3. Workspace name appears in the sidebar
4. Tasks populate the sidebar
5. Click a task to run it

Tasks execute inside the live terminal session.

You can also type commands manually.

---

<a id="sparrowtoml-configuration"></a>
# sparrow.toml Configuration

Example configuration:

```
[workspace]
name = "my-project"

[tasks]
up = ["npm install"]
build = ["npm run build"]
test = ["npm test"]
```

Each task is defined as an **array of shell commands**.

Commands execute sequentially inside the terminal.

Example execution:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

---

<a id="current-task-format-important"></a>
# Current Task Format (Important)

The **current Sparrow runner only supports array-based task definitions.**

Correct:

```
[tasks]
test = ["pytest -q"]
```

Not yet supported by the current runner:

```
[tasks.test]
desc = "Run tests"
cmd = ["pytest -q"]
```

The structured format above is planned for future versions of Sparrow.

---

<a id="ui-features"></a>
# UI Features

The current Sparrow interface includes:

• Embedded terminal (xterm.js)  
• Sidebar task runner  
• Click-to-run commands  
• Clear terminal button  
• Responsive terminal resizing  
• Real PTY shell execution

---

<a id="implementation-notes"></a>
# Implementation Notes

Backend:

• PTY spawned with `portable-pty`  
• PTY writer stored using `OnceCell`  
• Shell output streamed via `tauri::Emitter`  
• TOML parsed using `toml` crate

Frontend:

• `xterm.js` terminal rendering  
• `FitAddon` for terminal resizing  
• events streamed via Tauri

---

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
# Troubleshooting

## Sparrow window does not open

Most likely you ran the wrong command.

Correct:

```
npm run tauri dev
```

Incorrect:

```
npm run dev
```

---

## Tasks do not appear

Sparrow could not find a `sparrow.toml` file.

Ensure the file exists somewhere above the backend working directory.

---

## Task error: "not an array"

Tasks must currently be arrays:

Correct:

```
[tasks]
test = ["pytest -q"]
```

---

<a id="roadmap"></a>
# Roadmap

Planned improvements:

• structured task definitions (`desc`, `cwd`, `cmd`)  
• workspace selection UI  
• toolchain validation (`[tools]`)  
• environment configuration (`[env]`)  
• secret references (`[secrets]`)  
• service orchestration (`[services]`)  
• workspace history  
• multi-workspace support  
• Sparrow CLI

---

<a id="philosophy"></a>
# Philosophy

Sparrow embraces the shell.

Instead of replacing it, Sparrow gives structure to repetition.

Commands you run frequently become tasks.  
Tasks become reproducible workflows.
